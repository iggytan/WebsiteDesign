<h1>Previous Projects</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React</h2>
<p>Design and build a client-side interactive and responsive website - in this instance I chose to implement the additional languages onto my portfolio.</p>
<p>The following criteria had to be met:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Implement responsive design considering independence of platform and device in use.</li>
<li>Apply user interface design principles and processes to enhance user experience.</li>
<li>Implement a solution using a framework or library that takes user experience and accessibility into consideration.</li>
<li> Implement client-side web scripting and apply scripting standards to add interactivity to a website.</li>
<li>Implement multimedia optimisation techniques for mobile web to enhance user experience on mobile platforms.</li>
<li>Plan and perform simple unit testing and debugging to produce reliable software.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Developing an SQL Database</h2>
<p>I was charged with the task of creating an SQL database based on an entertainment company scenario. In this scenario the name of the company is called "Eye Candy Cinemas" and it has several cinema complexes, each with several theatres.</p> 
<p>The company wants us to develop a database that will provide the basis for a website application it is developing.</p>

<p>The requirements are such that I needed to provide 5 functions for the client as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Show Cinema Information: provides cinema complex information, such as location and theatres; provides theatre information, such as seating and sound quality</li>
<li>Search for Cinema: allows to search for a cinema complex by city, and to search for a theatre in a city by seating capacity or by sound system</li>
<li>Search Movie Schedule:  allows to search movie schedules by a number of criteria, including: by title, by location, by cinema complex, by weekday, by date and time, by movie screened, and by ticket price</li>
<li>Show Movie Screening: information, including theatre, date, time, ticket prices, movie information</li>
<li>Monitor Movie Screenings:  allows to check how many movies are screened per day or per week in each location and each theatre. This could for an exact day or week, or as average over a week</li>
<li>Additionally, a sample data was created and various SQL Queries developed to provide certain functions based on what the client would need for their own clients</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creating a website</h2>

<p>In this project I used mainly HTML and CSS to develop my own website portfolio and it involved the following thought processes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Determining the type of website that I will design and build by identifying what type of information my site will provide. It also needs to be emphasised
that I will be developing a static website, so any content that I will be providing will have to be hard-coded in the html document</li>
<li>Identify the target audience by choosing a specific demographic and psychographic to target. In this instance a potential employer</li>
<li>Use the concepts of User-Centered Design and identify what type of information my target audience may want and how will they want to access that information</li>
<li>Check and briefly evaluate existing websites similar to my own planned website, and take notes on what ideas I want to include, avoid, or do differently in mine</li>
<li>Apply the web design principles to create the wireframes for my pages</li>
<li>Create my project plan to include the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the site</li>
<li>A brief description of the content the site will provide</li>
<li>The target audience</li>
<li>A brief discussion of the research conducted and the sites visited and what ideas I have gathered</li>
<li>The time plan showing time estimates (in hours) of each step of the website development including the details for planning, site build, and testing</li>
<li>The wireframe sketches, to let you plan carefully what content you will provide and how I will lay them out on the page, before I actually build the page</li>
<li>A brief test plan indicating how I intend to conduct my testing and what browser(s) I will use for testing my site</li>
</ul>
